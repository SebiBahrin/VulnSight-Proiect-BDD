VulnSight is a security orchestration platform that automates the CVE remediation lifecycle by utilizing a Python (Streamlit) frontend powered by a robust Oracle Database backend. The architecture distinguishes itself by delegating 100% of the business logic—including multi-factor risk scoring and SLA tracking—to the database layer through advanced PL/SQL packages and stored procedures. It employs Global Temporary Tables (GTT) for high-performance data aggregation and utilizes complex triggers to maintain transactional consistency between technical detections and remediation tickets. To ensure enterprise-grade security, the system implements SHA256 password hashing, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and an automated audit logging engine that tracks state changes across the infrastructure. Finally, the project features a fully automated data seeding pipeline using Python, ensuring referential integrity while simulating complex, real-world security scenarios.
